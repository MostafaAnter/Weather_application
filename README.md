# Weather App - Android Technical Task #

### [ðŸ‘‰ Video Demo for this task on youtube ðŸ‘ˆ](https://youtu.be/S6ppgoK1-rM)

### Weather application
- [x] Created android screen that has search bar on top.
- [x] Detected current location of the customer.
- [x] Using https://openweathermap.org/api. Current weather data web service to provide all the necessary data.
- [x] All permissions is properly handled .
- [x] There are no restrictions on use of external libraries.

### Project Dependency Graph ###
- App module
  depend on core + feature search current weather + library location tracker : contains app start point it may be a splash screen.
- Core module
  depend on nothing  : contains all sharable data among different modules.
- Feature Search current weather Module
  depend on core + library location tracker : contain search weather feature related ui and other staffs.
- Library location tracker
  depend on core : contain code of getting current user location.

### Use domain specific langauge ###
- Make gradle scripts easy
- Support Kotlin for better dependencies management by Using Domain-Specific Languages.
- Support autocomplete

### Modular architecture ###
- Speeds up builds
- Enable on demand delivery
- Simplify development
- Reuse modules across apps
- Experiment with new technologies
- Scale development teams
- Enables refactoring
- Simplifies test automation

### MVVM Inside each module
- each developer inside android team has a free to select suitable architecture for his module.

### Dependency injection with Hilt ###
- Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in our project.

### Enable AppCenter Pipelines ###
- Support CI so i can check different stages like build and run unit test
  before merge any branch to master branch.

### Detekt ###
- to make code style analysis and be sure follow best practice for writing kotlin code.

### Firebase crashlytics ###
- to rack bugs even though app moved to production

### To avoid 64k functions problem and get smaller apk ###
- Enables code shrinking, obfuscation, and optimization for only
- Enables resource shrinking, which is performed by the

### Data binding
- The Data Binding Library automatically generates the classes required to bind the views in the layout with your data objects.

### leakCanary
- to detect memory leak through debugging process that will improve app performance as well.

### Truth For unit test its recommended from google
- write unit test for [Search Validator Class](https://github.com/MostafaAnter/Weather_application/blob/master/feature_search_current_weather/src/test/java/app/anter/feature_search_current_weather/ui/usecase/SearchValidatorTest.kt)

### Reactive programming (Coroutines)
Coroutines is Google recommended solution for asynchronous programming on Android. Noteworthy features include the following:

- Lightweight: You can run many coroutines on a single thread due to support for suspension, which doesn't block the thread where the coroutine is running. Suspending saves memory over blocking while supporting many concurrent operations.
- Fewer memory leaks: Use structured concurrency to run operations within a scope.
- Built-in cancellation support: Cancellation is propagated automatically through the running coroutine hierarchy.
- Jetpack integration: Many Jetpack libraries include extensions that provide full coroutines support. Some libraries also provide their own coroutine scope that you can use for structured concurrency.

### PermissionsDispatcher ###
PermissionsDispatcher provides a simple annotation-based API to handle runtime permissions.
- Fully Kotlin/Java support
- Special permissions support
- 100% reflection-free
