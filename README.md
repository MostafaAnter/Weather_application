# Weather App - Android Technical Task #

### [ðŸ‘‰ Video Demo for this task on youtube ðŸ‘ˆ](https://youtu.be/_jTwuhQ3rqc)

### Weather application
 - [x] Created android screen that has search bar on top.
 - [x] Detected current location of the customer.
 - [x] Using https://openweathermap.org/api. Current weather data web service to provide all the necessary data.
 - [x] All permissions is properly handled .
 - [x] There are no restrictions on use of external libraries.

### Project Dependency Graph ###
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MostafaAnter/Android_Technical_Task/master/project.dot.png)
- App module depend on core + feature search : contains app start point it may be a splash screen.
- Core module depend on nothing  : contains all sharable data among different modules.
- Feature News Search Module depend on core : contain search feature related ui and other staffs.
- Feature News Detail Module depend on core : contain news detail feature related ui.

### Use domain specific langauge ###
- Make gradle scripts easy
- Support Kotlin for better dependencies management by Using Domain-Specific Languages.
- Support autocomplete

### Modular architecture ###
- Speeds up builds
- Enable on demand delivery
- Simplify development
- Reuse modules across apps
- Experiment with new technologies
- Scale development teams
- Enables refactoring
- Simplifies test automation

### MVVM Inside each module 
- each developer inside android team has a free to select suitable architecture for his module. 

### Dependency injection with Hilt ###
- Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in our project.

### Load and display paged data ###
- The Paging3 library provides powerful capabilities for loading and displaying paged data from a larger dataset.

### Enable AppCenter Pipelines ###
- Support CI so i can check different stages like build and run unit test 
before merge any branch to master branch.

### Detekt ###
- to make code style analysis and be sure follow best practice for writing kotlin code.

### Firebase crashlytics ###
- to rack bugs even though app moved to production

### To avoid 64k functions problem and get smaller apk ###
- Enables code shrinking, obfuscation, and optimization for only
- Enables resource shrinking, which is performed by the

### Data binding
- The Data Binding Library automatically generates the classes required to bind the views in the layout with your data objects.

### leakCanary 
- to detect memory leak through debugging process that will improve app performance as well. 

### Truth For unit test its recommended from google
- write unit test for [Search Validator Class](https://github.com/MostafaAnter/Android_Technical_Task/blob/master/feature_news_search/src/test/java/app/anter/feature_news_search/ui/usecase/SearchValidatorTest.kt)
- write integrated test for ensure [Database work fine](https://github.com/MostafaAnter/Android_Technical_Task/blob/master/core/src/androidTest/java/app/anter/core/local/database/AppDatabaseTest.kt)

### Reactive programming (Coroutines)
Coroutines is Google recommended solution for asynchronous programming on Android. Noteworthy features include the following:

- Lightweight: You can run many coroutines on a single thread due to support for suspension, which doesn't block the thread where the coroutine is running. Suspending saves memory over blocking while supporting many concurrent operations.
- Fewer memory leaks: Use structured concurrency to run operations within a scope.
- Built-in cancellation support: Cancellation is propagated automatically through the running coroutine hierarchy.
- Jetpack integration: Many Jetpack libraries include extensions that provide full coroutines support. Some libraries also provide their own coroutine scope that you can use for structured concurrency.

### Local database using Room ###
- Compile-time verification of SQL queries.
- Convenience annotations that minimize repetitive and error-prone boilerplate code.
- Streamlined database migration paths.
